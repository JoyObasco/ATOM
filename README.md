# ATOM is a journey of my love and desire to learn programming. 

Getting time is sometimes hard but it has always been my believe that you make time for the things and people you love.

I'm a beginner and I love learning so if you spot a mistake or more please reach out at obayemigbemisola@gmail.com, help me learn and correct them.

What I've learnt so far?

1. HTML: It wasn't easy at first, there was a tag for everything and I often mixed them up but I think I have it down now. <p>Mostly anyways, laughs nervously</p>
2. CSS: It felt like there was even more information to learn here, who knew getting your site to look dope was such work? I'm still learning and I admit I still get stuck sometimes but gotta keep grinding.

Thank you for checking my repository out.
